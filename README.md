# machine-learning-zoomcamp2025-homework
Hello!

I joined this Machine Learning Zoomcamp cohort of 2025 in order to enhance and practise my ML and maths skills. I have already completed the TinyML course from HarvardX, [View certificate](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/8b4172259cb742a49bd4ea5425a97b55).
This online learning initiative of Harvard University taught me the development of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and how to deploy the ANN models on microcontroller devices.

My goals for this ML Zoomcamp 2025 are to explore other ML model developments and advance my career in the field.
