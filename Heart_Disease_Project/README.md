# Heart Disease Binary Classification (scikit-learn)

Description
-----------
This project builds a binary classifier to predict the presence of heart disease from clinical features using the "heart disease dataset" available at:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

Why this problem matters
- Early detection of heart disease can guide clinical decisions and help prioritize patients for further tests.
- A classification model can estimate risk given routine clinical and lab features.
- The model can be used as a lightweight screening tool (not a substitute for clinical judgement).
